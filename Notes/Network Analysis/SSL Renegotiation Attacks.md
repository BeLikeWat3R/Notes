HTTPS, unlike HTTP is a stateful protocol, the connection works as follows: 

	Handshake:

		The server & client undergo a handshake when establishing connection. During the handshake the types of encryption to use is determined & they exchange their certificates. 


	Encryption: 
		
		When the handshake finishes, the client & server use the agreed upon encryption algorithm to encrypt future data
