Through static analysis we want to find as much information as possible including: 

| File type          |
| ------------------ |
| File hash          |
| Strings            |
| Embedded elements  |
| Packer information |
| Imports            |
| Exports            |
| Assembly code      |

-----------------------------------------

**Identifying File Type:** 

The easiest way to determine the file type is with the `file` command

```shell

file [path]

```
``
To manually check the header use `hexdump`
