With no source code, analysts are forced to disassemble binaries & look at their assembly code to ascertain what they do & how they work. 

To do  disassemblers and debuggers are employed: 

Disassembler: 

A tool that is used to step through the code without executing it. This allows for gaining an understanding of the logic & structure of the code without running it. Examples are IDA, Cutter, and Ghidra

Debugger:

Like a disassembler, they disassemble binaries into their assembly instructions. It also allows use to execute code in a controlled environment - going by instruction to instruction, skipping to specific lines, or halting flow by using breakpoints. Examples are OllyDbg, x32dbg, x64dbg, and IDA

Code Analysis: 

The process of investigating & deciphering the behavior
