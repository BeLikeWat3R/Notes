With no source code, analysts are forced to disassemble binaries & look at their assembly code to ascertain what they do & how they work. 

To do  disassemblers and debuggers are employed: 

**Disassembler**: 

A tool that is used to step through the code without executing it. This allows for gaining an understanding of the logic & structure of the code without running it. Examples are `IDA, Cutter, and Ghidra`

**Debugger**:

Like a disassembler, they disassemble binaries into their assembly instructions. It also allows use to execute code in a controlled environment - going by instruction to instruction, skipping to specific lines, or halting flow by using breakpoints. Examples are `OllyDbg, x32dbg, x64dbg, and IDA`

**Code Analysis:** 

The process of investigating & deciphering the behavior & functionality of a compiled binary/program. This involves analyzing instructions, control flow, and data structures within the code to determine the sample's function, purpose, and to derive IOCs.

**Disassembly:** 

Allows for an understanding by reversing the compilation process. When machine code is converted back into Assembly - we end up with instructions that are symbolic & mnemonic, allowing us to determine the logic & structure of the program.

The process is below for brevity:

IDA: 

In order to load a sample into IDA, click on the 'new' button & select the sample. 

Once the file format is determined by IDA, the sample will be disassemble the sample into Assembly

Below are the different views within IDA:
