Debugging adds a dynamic & interactive element to analyzing code allowing for real time behavioral analysis. 

Analyzing code & debugging together allows for comprehensive understanding of the sample. 

We will use x64dbg for debugging in this example with shell.exe

Below we can see the default views & the first breakpoint (at the beginning of the code) for the sample.

**Simulating Connectivity:** 

In order to make the malware think it is not within a lab environment we will utilize `inetsim`.

Use the following command to edit the config file for inetsim 

```
sudo [text editor] /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf
```

Once tweaked to our liking, we can run it with: 

```
sudo inetsim
```

**Applying Patches to Bypass Sandbox Checks:** 

Given if a sample detects it is within a sandbox, it will hinder its execution - we need to defeat these checks. There are several methods:
