Windows operates in two main modes: 


**User-Mode:** 

Most applications & user processes happen here, applications ran within user mode have very limited access to hardware & have to interact with the OS via APIs. These processes are isolated and cannot directly access hardware/critical functions.

Malware is still able to manipulate files, registry, network connections, etc. & may escalate its privilege in order to gain more control. 

-------------------------------------------

**Kernel-Mode:** 

A much more privileged environment where the Windows kernel runs. The kernel has unfettered access to hardware, system resources, and critical functions. It provides core OS services, manages resources, and enforces security & stability. Device drivers also run within it. 

If malware runs within kernel mode, it will gain elevated control & can manipulate system behavior, conceal itself, intercept syscalls, and tamper with security.

**User-Mode Components:** 

Parts of the OS that do not have direct access to hardware/kernel. They interact with system resources through API & syscalls

**Windows API Call Flow:** 

Malware often uses APIs to interact with system resources to carry out operations.

For example: 

Assume a user-mode application tries to access privileged operations and system resources using the `ReadProcessMemory` function (allows a process to read the memory of other processes). 


Call Flow Diagram: `ReadProcessMemory`

![ReadProcessMemory_Call](/Assets/Malware%20Analysis/wininternals_syscall.webp)

Required parameters passed for `ReadProcessMemory`: 

```cmd
BOOL ReadProcessMemory(
  [in]  HANDLE  hProcess,
  [in]  LPCVOID lpBaseAddress,
  [out] LPVOID  lpBuffer,
  [in]  SIZE_T  nSize,
  [out] SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesRead
);

```


`ReadProcessMemory` is a WINAPI function that belongs to the `kernel32.dll` library (the user-mode interface to the WINAPI).

The `kernel32.dll` module interacts with the NTDLL.dll module, which provides a lower-level interface to the Windows kernel

Next the function request is translated to the native API call, which in this case is `NtReadVirtualMemory`

See below for a screenshot from the debugger:

The NTDLL.dll module uses syscalls: 

![ntdll](/Assets/Malware%20Analysis/msdn_004_syscall_instruction.webp)

The `syscall` instruction triggers the system call using the parameters set in previous instructions. It transfers control from user-mode to kernel-mode. The kernel will perform the requested operation after validating the parameters and checking the rights of the calling process.

If authorized, the thread transitions to kernel-mode. The kernel maintains a table called System Service Descriptor Table (`SSDT`) or the `Syscall` Table, which contain pointers to various system service routines. These routines handle `syscalls` made by user-mode applications. Each entry corresponds to a specific `syscall` number and the pointer points to the corresponding kernel function that implements the requested operation. 

The `syscall` responsible for `ReadProcessMemory` is executed in the kernel (where Windows manages memory & leverages process isolation mechanisms). The kernel performs validations, access checks, and memory operations to read memory from the target process. The kernel then retrieves the physical memory pages in regard to the requested virtual address and copies that data into the provided buffer. 

When the kernel has finished reading the memory, it transitions the thread back to user-mode and control is returned to the original user-mode application that made the call. The application can now access the data that was read from the target process' memory and continue its execution
