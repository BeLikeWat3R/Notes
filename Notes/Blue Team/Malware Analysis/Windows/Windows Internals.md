Windows operates in two main modes: 


**User Mode:** 

Most applications & user processes happen here, applications ran within user mode have very limited access to hardware & have to interact with the OS via APIs. These processes are isolated and cannot directly access hardware/critical functions.

Malware is still able to manipulate files, registry, network connections, etc. & may escalate its privilege in order to gain more control. 


**Kernel Mode:** 

A much more privileged environment where the Windows kernel runs. The kernel has unfettered access to hardware, system resources, and critical functions. It provides core OS services, manages resources, and enforces security & stability. Device drivers also run within it
