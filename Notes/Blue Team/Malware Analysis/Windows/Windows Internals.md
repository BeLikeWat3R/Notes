Windows operates in two main modes: 


**User Mode:** 

Most applications & user processes happen here, applications ran within user mode have very limited access to hardware & have to interact with the OS via APIs. These processes are isolated and cannot directly access hardware/critical functions.

Malware is still able to manipulate files, registry, network connections, etc. & may escalate its privilege in order to gain more control. 

-------------------------------------------

**Kernel Mode:** 

A much more privileged environment where the Windows kernel runs. The kernel has unfettered access to hardware, system resources, and critical functions. It provides core OS services, manages resources, and enforces security & stability. Device drivers also run within it. 

If malware runs within kernel mode, it will gain elevated control & can manipulate system behavior, conceal itself, intercept syscalls, and tamper with security.

-------------------------------------------

**User Mode Components:** Parts of the OS that do not have direct access to hardware/kernel. They interact with system resources through API & syscalls
