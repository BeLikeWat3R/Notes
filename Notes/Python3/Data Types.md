- **Index:** (method is called subscripting: Position of what string you want (e.g. "Hello"[0]) will print H – the first character or position 0.   
    
- **Integer:** Whole number with no decimal places, plain syntax. Big numbers use the (_) instead of commas to split them up into easier chunks for easier visualization, code just ignores it.  
    
- **Float:** Short for floating point number, numbers with decimal places. 
    

- **Boolean:** True/False, the only two valid values. Has to be coded as written -  
    

- **type:** Function that shows what kind of data type you've coded.  
    

**Typecasting:** Switches the type of data type like so. 
		Num = int(new_num). 
- 
- Must be = to a variable.  
    

- To add exponents you would use 2 asterisks side by side.  
    

- To divide a number and round it up (not be a float) use the // instead of /.  
    

- If you need to do more math quickly, set the first calculation to a variable (then when doing your operation, add an = to the math sign e.g. score +=1) 
    

- **F-String:** Allows you to work with different data types together, use by placing f at line 0 of the string. VARIABLES MUST BE IN CURLY BRACKETS {}.  
    

- **Rounding:** Within a normal variable, you can use the round function to round a variable to decimal points, this must be written as (variable, decimal point).  
    
    - Alternatively: you can put it in a string "{:.decimal pointf}". This mostly used to add extra decimal places to inputs, such as a 0 in the tip calculator.
