**Registers:** The fastest components within the computer but can only hold a few bytes at a time. 

Data Registers: Used for storing instructions/syscall arguments. 


| Register          | Description                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rax (Accumulator) | Frequently used for arithmetic operations and as a return value in functions                                     |
|  (Base)           | Often used as a base address for memory operations                                                               |
| RCX (Count)       | Commonly used as a counter for loops and shifts                                                                  |
| RDX (Data)        | Often used in arithmetic operations such as multiplication and division, and as an additional function parameter |
| R8 - 15           | General purpose registers, can be used when all others are in use                                                |
