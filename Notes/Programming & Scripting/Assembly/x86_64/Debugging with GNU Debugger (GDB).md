**Steps of Debugging:** 

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Break** | Setting breakpoints at various points of interest in the code to pause execution and inspect the program's state. |
| **Examine** | Running the program and examining its state at breakpoints, including checking variable values, memory contents, and the call stack. |
| **Step** | Moving through the program one instruction or line of code at a time to observe its behavior and how user input affects it. |
| **Modify** | Changing values in specific registers or memory addresses at breakpoints to study how these modifications impact program execution. |

**Break:** 

Breakpoints are set when specific parameters are met so we can examine the program & register values at that particular point. This allows for stepping into instructions to determine how they change the binary & values.
