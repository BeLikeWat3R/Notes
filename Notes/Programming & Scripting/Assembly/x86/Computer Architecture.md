**Von Neumann Architecture:** 

Consists of these main elements: 

CPU, Memory, and I/O devices

-----------------------------------------


**CPU:** 

Consists of Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and Registers

-----------------------------------------


**Memory:** 

Consists of Cache and RAM


	Cache: 

		Exists to access upcoming instructions quicker than retireving them from RAM. It is much faster than RAM 


	Cache Levels: 


| Level | Description                                                                                                    |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Usually in kilobytes, the fastest memory available, located in each CPU core. (Only registers are faster.)<br> |
| 2     | Usually in megabytes, extremely fast (but slower than L1), shared between all CPU cores.<br>                   |
| 3     | Usually in megabytes (larger than L2), faster than RAM but slower than L1/L2. (Not all CPUs use L3.)<br>       |


	RAM: 
		
		Much larger than cache and also much slower. When a program is run, all data & instructions are moved from the storage unit into RAM to be accessed when needed up the CPU. There are 4 segments of RAM.
