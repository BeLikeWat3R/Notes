**Control Unit:** Moves & Controls Data

**Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs various mathematical & logical operations as requested from a program via Assembly

The way in which and how efficiently a CPU processes instructions depends on its Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). There are various ISAs but two important ones are 

	RISC: 
	
		Handles more simple instructions, taking more CPU cycles, but uses less power & has shorter cycles

	CISC: 
	
	Handles fewer, more complex instructions, which take fewer cycles but have longer cycles and use more power
